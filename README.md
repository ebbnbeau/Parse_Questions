# Parse_Questions

I stumbled across some python practice questions while exploring GitHub. It's one of Jeffrey Hu's repositories. (github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises)

This is a great file with questions, hints, answers, and even levels of proficiency. Now I'm the type to study/practice without any solutions, otherwise I will go straight for the answers.

I skimmed through the file, and at first, I wanted to just copy/paste each question to a word doc (mundane much?), but figured, hey why not use python to parse these questions and make this into a mini assignment

That's exactly what I did... Probably not the best way to parse this and end result looks tacky, but it got the job done.

Enjoy!
