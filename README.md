# Parse_Questions

I stumbled across some python practice questions while exploring GitHub. It's one of Jeffrey Hu's repositories. (github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises)

This is a great file with questions, hints, answers, and even levels of proficiency. Unfortunately, I'm the type to jump straight to the answers because of urges, amirite???? So I have to take out the answers.

I skimmed through the file, and at first, I wanted to just copy/paste each question to a word doc (mundane much?), but figured, hey why not use python to parse these questions and make this into a mini assignment

That's exactly what I did... Script is tacky, but it got the job done.

Enjoy!
